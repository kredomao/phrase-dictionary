00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:01,389
Hi everyone, I'm Lorena

2
00:00:01,857 --> 00:00:02,470
and I'm Phillip.

3
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:03,522
and welcome back to...

4
00:00:03,822 --> 00:00:04,507
Break It Kids!

5
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:07,147
your movement break for your brain, body...

6
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:08,665
and senses.

7
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:10,711
Break It Kids!

8
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,329
Today, we've got a very special mission.

9
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,652
A whole lot of different types of fruit have gotten lost in Candyland,

10
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:19,731
and we need to save them from all that sugar.

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,638
Now, a little bit of sugar is OK,

12
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,417
but a whole land made of

13
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:23,844
sugar?

14
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:25,280
That's just too much.

15
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,241
Luckily, we have a map to help us find our way.

16
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:30,344
But first,

17
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,017
as always,

18
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,023
we fire it up.

19
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:35,725
Let's get rescuing.

20
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,194
Now, according to our map,

21
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:41,044
the bananas are stuck in the candy cane and lollipop forest.

22
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:42,877
Let's head there first.

23
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,584
Wow, these candy canes are so tall,

24
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:49,161
and the bananas are stuck right at the top.

25
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:50,940
How did they even get there?

26
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,874
To get the bananas down,

27
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,931
we're going to shake the candy cane just like this

28
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:57,749
as hard as you can, moving your whole body.

29
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:59,065
And then as the bananas fall,

30
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,327
we're going to do star jumps on the spot j

31
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:02,156
just like this.

32
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,614
And then they're going to plop into our magic bag.

33
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,568
Ready, kids?

34
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,307
Let's go. OK,

35
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:08,596
start with the shaking.

36
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,537
Move your whole body.

37
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,588
That's a big candy cane. Come on.

38
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:15,101
Here they come. Ready?

39
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:18,056
Catch them. There's one.

40
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:19,372
Come on, kids.

41
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:20,533
We have to keep moving.

42
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,301
That's two. Yes, kids.

43
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,342
OK, last one on this one.

44
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:25,891
Ready?

45
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,068
Caught it, yes.

46
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,254
Into our bag, nice and safe.

47
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,094
Let's move to the next candy cane.

48
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:32,682
OK, here it is.

49
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,965
Ready, and shake as hard as you can.

50
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:36,941
Come on, move your whole body.

51
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:39,476
Remember, this is far enough. Let's go, let's go.

52
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:40,535
OK, they're loose.

53
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:41,357
Star jumps.

54
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,441
Here we go.

55
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,310
That's one.

56
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:44,293
Come on, kids.

57
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,350
That's two.

58
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,197
Remember, this is far enough.

59
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,533
And the last one's on its way.

60
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:50,309
Come on.

61
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,193
Almost there.

62
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,097
And we got them. Yes, kids.

63
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,594
Into our bag, nice and safe.

64
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,597
Now it's time to split

65
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,141
and head to the next area.

66
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,397
Now the map says the apples are at the top of Mount Gumdrop.

67
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:03,394
We're going to have to get all the way to the top

68
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,287
to save them.

69
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:07,086
But there's one big problem.

70
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,482
Gumdrops are rolling down as we're going to go up.

71
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,516
We're going to have to miss them all

72
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,446
and get right to the top.

73
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,394
To do that,

74
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,377
we're going to sprint on the spot just like this,

75
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:16,913
as quick as you can.

76
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:17,820
And then,

77
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,125
as the gumdrops come,

78
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,088
we're going to hop over them, just like this.

79
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:22,532
Follow me,

80
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:23,662
and we can do this.

81
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:24,470
Ready, kids?

82
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,030
Let's go.

83
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:25,801
OK,

84
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,613
we're going to have to start quick.

85
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,919
This is a big mountain. So the faster we go,

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,754
the quicker we can get to the top.

87
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:33,774
And remember, this is

88
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:37,680
So let me give you max energy. Come on, kids.

89
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,179
OK, now come the first gumdrops.

90
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:40,822
Ready, hop,

91
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,147
and again, hop,

92
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,794
and again, hop.

93
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,699
Last one.

94
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,995
Excellent work, kids. Now sprint again.

95
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:50,102
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

96
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,345
All the way to the top.

97
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,766
Here we go, we're halfway.

98
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:53,877
Wow, this is tough.

99
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,099
More gumdrops. Ready,

100
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,425
hop, sprint again.

101
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,954
More gumdrops, hop,

102
00:02:58,548 --> 00:02:59,244
hop again,

103
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,636
and again.

104
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,462
OK, last little bit.

105
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:05,137
I can see one or two more gumdrops left.

106
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:05,659
Come on,

107
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,898
last one now, hop,

108
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:08,887
and again, hop,

109
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,033
and last little bit,

110
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,163
and we made it.

111
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,631
Look at that.

112
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:14,868
The apples are all safe.

113
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:18,429
I guess they're just enjoying the nice view.

114
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:19,781
Come on, guys.

115
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,992
Into the bag, please.

116
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:27,634
Now the next fruit on the map are mangoes, and it looks like they're hiding in a cupcake maze.

117
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:27,978
Hmm,

118
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:30,558
those are some pretty cheeky mangoes.

119
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:33,653
To find them, we're going to do scissor kicks on the spot like this,

120
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,345
and then you're going to follow my directions.

121
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,709
We're either going to go straight,

122
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,378
to the left, or

123
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:39,829
to the right.

124
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,439
Ready, kids, let's go.

125
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:42,466
OK,

126
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:46,109
this is a big maze, so we're going to have to use max effort to find them all.

127
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,356
OK, to the left,

128
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,548
there we go.

129
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,910
Wow, that's a lot of cupcakes.

130
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:51,989
And to the right.

131
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,481
Excellent, kids.

132
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,527
And straight.

133
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:55,815
There's the first one.

134
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:56,852
Speed up, come on.

135
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,590
Come on, you little cheeky mango.

136
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,189
You're not going to get away from us.

137
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:01,601
And we got him, yes!

138
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:02,642
Into the bag.

139
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,041
OK, turn left.

140
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:05,778
Oh, this is tough work, isn't it?

141
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,594
And to the right.

142
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:07,910
Here we go.

143
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:08,972
Straight again.

144
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:10,398
And to the left.

145
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:11,706
Come on, kids,

146
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:12,808
there's another one!

147
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:14,252
Speed it up. Let's go, let's go.

148
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,499
Come on, cheeky mango, we're going to get you.

149
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,728
And we got him, yes.

150
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,673
Into the bag.

151
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,963
OK, straight now.

152
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:21,498
And then to the right.

153
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,393
Come on, kids, this is fired up. Let's go.

154
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,505
And straight again.

155
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:25,688
There's the last one.

156
00:04:25,786 --> 00:04:26,950
Speed up, come on.

157
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,284
And we got him.

158
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:29,380
Yes, kids.

159
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,709
Into the bag.

160
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,437
Glad those cheeky mangoes are in our bag.

161
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,509
Now to get out of here.

162
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,196
Time to focus it.

163
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,161
Unpeel your brain.

164
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:48,025
According to our map, the grapes are on Candy Floss Lane. Let's head over.

165
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:50,687
Oh no,

166
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:54,508
it looks like our little grape friends are stuck in a

167
00:04:54,508 --> 00:04:55,681
sticky floss.

168
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:56,969
Let's help them out.

169
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,811
To do that, we're going to bounce on one leg like this,

170
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:00,583
reach down,

171
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,118
grab our little grape friend

172
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,191
and put it in the bag.

173
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:04,838
And then

174
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:05,833
repeat on the other side,

175
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,680
just like this.

176
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,874
Excellent, let's go.

177
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,801
Okay, balancing here,

178
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,095
maximum focus.

179
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:16,932
All right, let's reach down to grab the grape.

180
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,897
Go, you got him.

181
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:19,596
Yes,

182
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:21,008
okay, first one done.

183
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:21,891
Other side.

184
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,888
Now this takes maximum effort.

185
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:24,575
Let's go.

186
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,498
Go, whoa,

187
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,241
it's a bit wobbly.

188
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,516
Yes,

189
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,540
okay, now this floss is sticky,

190
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,209
so come on,

191
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:33,238
stick with me.

192
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:34,697
Okay, balancing here.

193
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,120
Get that little grape.

194
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,802
Oh, it's so sticky.

195
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:39,724
Yes,

196
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,076
okay, here's another one.

197
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,185
Okay, we've got to be gentle, they're just grapes.

198
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:46,751
Don't squeeze too hard.

199
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:48,122
There we go, okay.

200
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,515
Two more,

201
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,741
balancing here.

202
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,723
Reach down,

203
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,762
that's it, and one more.

204
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:56,664
Yes,

205
00:05:56,996 --> 00:06:01,135
these silly grapes, they should never be allowed to wander around all by themselves.

206
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,816
I'm glad we got them all.

207
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:08,258
According to the map, our last fruit, the pineapple, is bobbing around in the chocolate river.

208
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,120
Now,

209
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,454
I've got an idea.

210
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,584
Let's hop on our chocolate slab

211
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,072
and use a lollipop to row them out

212
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,874
before they get way too soggy.

213
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,245
To do that,

214
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,973
kneel just like this,

215
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:23,416
and then take your giant lollipop

216
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:27,739
and row on either side of your body just like this to get the pineapples out.

217
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,018
Ready, kids? Let's go.

218
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:31,827
All right, hold on to your lollipop.

219
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:33,177
Let's start rowing.

220
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,546
That's it.

221
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,097
Okay, now this is tricky.

222
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,491
So again, focus it, kids.

223
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,487
Side to side across the body just like that.

224
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,268
Oh, there's our first pineapple.

225
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,760
Yes, we got it.

226
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:46,644
Excellent.

227
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,658
I mean, it looks like a pineapple spot here.

228
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:52,103
They look so relaxed in this chocolate river.

229
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,498
And I'm not gonna lie,

230
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,355
I could do with a cheeky taste.

231
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,334
There we go, another one.

232
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,912
Excellent, keep it up.

233
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:00,323
All right, let's row a little bit faster.

234
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:01,426
Come on, everyone.

235
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:02,910
There's another one.

236
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,152
Yes, well done.

237
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,998
It's a bit wobbly.

238
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:08,268
Keep your tummy tight.

239
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:09,393
Try not to fall in.

240
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,620
Let's go. Come on, everyone.

241
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,699
Oh, this chocolate looks so yummy.

242
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,957
Keep it up.

243
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,858
Yes, we got the last one.

244
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,804
Great rowing, kids. We have them all.

245
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:23,585
And we used a chocolate slab and a lollipop.

246
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:24,540
How cool.

247
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,951
Well done, team. We've saved all the fruit.

248
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:35,335
Now, according to the map, the only way to get out of Candyland and to keep these fruits safe is to go across the Biscuit Bridge.

249
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,601
Sounds pretty cool. All right, let's grab the bag, everyone.

250
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,724
Oh, it's heavy. Come on.

251
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,185
Yes.

252
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,008
Now, I've got a bit of a crazy idea.

253
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,257
We made it across the Biscuit Bridge,

254
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:54,182
but what if we now smash the Biscuit Bridge

255
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,298
to keep all of our fruit nice and safe

256
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,819
and to keep them from sneaking in all the time?

257
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:02,106
Luckily, we've got this Popsicle as a hammer

258
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,955
that we can use to smash it.

259
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:07,084
All right, to do that, we're gonna pick up our Popsicle

260
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,200
and then do a figure of eight

261
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,220
just like this,

262
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,186
and then squat down,

263
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,334
smash the bridge just like that.

264
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,554
Ready, kids? Let's go.

265
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:18,901
All right, pick up your Popsicle.

266
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,620
Figure of eight, nice and controlled.

267
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,266
And get ready to smash.

268
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,278
Squat, smash.

269
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,000
Excellent.

270
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,268
Okay, this is a really strong bridge.

271
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:28,796
Spending maximum effort.

272
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,568
Ready, squat.

273
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:31,509
Boom.

274
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,221
Okay, not yet.

275
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,000
Come on, everyone. We've gotta keep the fruit safe

276
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,938
and the Candyland residents

277
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,390
Squat, smash.

278
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,318
That's it, keep it up.

279
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,559
Figure of eight, nice and controlled.

280
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,056
Can't believe we have a Popsicle as a hammer.

281
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:48,467
This is too cool.

282
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:50,437
Here we go, it's starting to crumble.

283
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:52,044
That's it, keep it up.

284
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,617
And use all your strength.

285
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:54,970
Boom,

286
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:56,151
nice.

287
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,899
Okay, one more time. Come on, it's almost there.

288
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,308
We've almost broken it. Ready?

289
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,332
Yes, there it goes.

290
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,602
Great work, kids.

291
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,158
That biscuit bridge didn't stand a

292
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:12,439
And some would say that's how the biscuit crumbles.

293
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:15,565
Now that was a fruit-alicious adventure.

294
00:09:15,784 --> 00:09:17,002
But now it's time

295
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:18,123
to cool it.

296
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:25,589
For our first cool it exercise,

297
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,019
we're going to do sunshine breath.

298
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,721
So you can imagine you're a big, warm, bright sun.

299
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,637
Sitting in a comfortable position, just like this,

300
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,339
you can breathe in through your nose.

301
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:38,804
Imagine you're that sun that's just getting bigger.

302
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,822
And then as you breathe out through your mouth,

303
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:46,016
you're going to spread your warm rays of sunshine all over.

304
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:47,321
Ready, kids? Let's go.

305
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,514
In through your nose.

306
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,336
And then breathe out through your mouth.

307
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,363
Imagine those rays spreading all around you.

308
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,281
Go again. In through your nose.

309
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:06,392
And out through your mouth.

310
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:14,165
Imagine the rays getting brighter and warmer each time you breathe out.

311
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,015
Let's go again.

312
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:26,136
You can also send those sunshine rays to someone that you love.

313
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,155
In through your nose.

314
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:31,876
And out through your mouth.

315
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,681
What a great way to calm your mind and body down.

316
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,897
And you get to spread some sunshine around.

317
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:41,723
Excellent work.

318
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,095
For our final cool it exercise,

319
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,974
we're going to do cat-cow breathing.

320
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,869
To do that, we're going to go down onto all fours,

321
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:48,442
just like this.

322
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,019
And then when you breathe in through your nose,

323
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,908
you're going to arch your back and look up like a cow.

324
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,924
And then when you breathe out through your mouth,

325
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,682
you're going to arch your back the other way like a cat.

326
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:02,406
Super simple.

327
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,695
Ready, kids? Let's go.

328
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,435
Breathing in through your nose.

329
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,846
And then all the way out through your mouth.

330
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,601
Arch your back.

331
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,137
Remember to tuck your chin in.

332
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:15,988
Let's try again.

333
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,975
In through your nose.

334
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,480
And out through your mouth.

335
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,417
You can close your eyes if you want to.

336
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:26,982
Ready?

337
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:28,095
In through your nose.

338
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,862
And out through your mouth.

339
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:38,444
It's like a good stretch and breathing at the same time.

340
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:39,861
In through your nose.

341
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,293
And out through your mouth.

342
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,723
Excellent work, kids.

343
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,998
That's a great stretch to do any time.

344
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:53,658
Well done.

345
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,519
Now, remember to always keep an eye on your fruit.

346
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,718
You never know if they might wander off.

347
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,010
See you soon.

348
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,113
Break it, kids.

349
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,541
Break it, kids.
